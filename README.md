# Robotic Car Safety System Readme

Welcome to the Robotic Car Safety System project repository. This comprehensive document provides an overview of the project, its purpose, components, setup instructions, usage guidelines, contribution opportunities, and licensing information.

## Introduction

The Robotic Car Safety System is a sophisticated project designed to augment the safety features of a robotic car. By incorporating a variety of sensors and control mechanisms, the system ensures the safe operation of the robotic car in various environments. This project serves as an educational and practical platform for showcasing the integration of multiple sensors, actuators, and decision-making logic within the context of robotics. Also communicate with the user through the wifi using the CallMeBot api.

## Components

- Arduino UNO
- DOIT ESP 32 DEVKIT V1
- LiquidCrystal I2C Display
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Gas Sensor
- Infrared (IR) Sensor
- Motor Controller Module (L298N)
- Various LEDs and buzzers

Libraries used:

-Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library

-DHT-sensor-library

The system performs the following tasks:

1. **Obstacle Detection**: Utilizes the ultrasonic distance sensor to detect obstacles in front of the car. It adjusts the car's movement to avoid collisions.

2. **Gas Level Monitoring**: Monitors the gas sensor's analog input to detect harmful gas levels. If the gas value exceeds a threshold, the car stops and displays a warning message.

3. **Temperature Monitoring**: Reads the DHT11 sensor to measure temperature. If the temperature goes above a certain threshold, the system triggers a warning LED and displays a message on the LCD.

4. **Lane Detection**: Uses the IR sensor to detect lane markings. If the sensor value indicates the car is drifting off the lane, the car adjusts its movement to stay within the lane.

5. **LCD Display**: Shows real-time information such as gas levels, temperature, and distance on the LiquidCrystal I2C display.

6. **Motor Control**: Controls the car's movement based on sensor readings. It adjusts the speed and direction of the motors to navigate and respond to obstacles.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/AshFahim/car-crash-detection-and-notification-bot
   ```

2. Connect all the components according to the pin configuration specified in the code.

3. Upload the provided Arduino code (`/Arduino uno/project.ino`) to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
4. Include the necessary libraries in the Arduino IDE.
5. Edit the provided ESP code (`/ESP32 DEVKIT V1/esp.ino`) and add wifi SSID and password. I used CallMeBot api you can add yours. Upload the code to your ESP32 Devkit using the Arduino IDE.
6. Power up the system and observe the car's behavior based on the sensor inputs.
